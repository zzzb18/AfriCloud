How Agriculture is Catalysing Africa’s Industrial Growth
Agriculture continues to serve as a cornerstone of Africa’s economic landscape, now playing a transformative role in driving industrialisation across the continent. For instance, in 2023, agriculture accounted for approximately 18–19% of GDP across African countries (GlobalEconomy.com).

Beyond its contribution to national output, the sector remains a dominant source of employment. When expanded to include agrifood systems, such as processing, logistics, and retail, agriculture directly and indirectly supports over 300 million jobs, representing around 65% of Africa’s total employment (The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA)). This substantial labour force underpins a burgeoning agro-industrial sector and creates rising demand for industrial infrastructure such as processing zones, logistics hubs, and specialised warehousing. Transitioning from primary agricultural production to value-added processing substantially enhances economic returns.

Agro-industrialisation boosting real estate demand.

Agro-processing is transforming real estate demand across Africa. With approximately two-thirds of the continent’s manufacturing value added sourced from agricultural inputs (FAO), the expansion of agricultural value chains is driving significant demand for real estate assets such as processing facilities, industrial parks, cold storage units, and logistics hubs. A notable example is Nigeria’s Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs), which have secured US$ 2.2 bn in investment commitments (AfDB). These zones are catalysing the development of agro-industrial hubs across 24 states, focused on priority commodities such as cassava, sugarcane, rice, and leather. This initiative is generating sustained demand for feed collection centres, grain storage silos, cold rooms, sorting facilities, and other value-chain-related real estate assets.

Key trends: Innovation and Mechanisation

Technological innovation in agriculture is creating stronger forward linkages into industry, fundamentally reshaping real estate demand in rural and peri-urban areas. Mechanisation and digital tools are enhancing productivity, streamlining post-harvest handling, and increasing processing throughput.

Digital agriculture, in particular, is proving instrumental in reducing post-harvest losses, estimated at 30–40% for grains and up to 70% for perishables (Africa Eats), resulting in higher and more consistent volumes for cold chains, milling operations, and packaging industries. This shift is reinforcing the need for investment in logistics infrastructure, training facilities, equipment storage, and agro-industrial clusters.

Innovative platforms like Hello Tractor not only offer mechanisation services but also train farmers in equipment use and build out ecosystems for maintenance, spare parts, and fuel access, each element creating demand for associated industrial real estate. In Kenya, tools such as Ujuzi’s soil testing kits and mobile applications that connect farmers to buyers,

market forecasts, and agronomic advice are improving yields and reducing input risk, ensuring reliable supply streams for processors.
